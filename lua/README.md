will this work properly, can you explain it?

```lua
-- a.lua
function hello()
    print("hello")
end
```

```lua
-- b.lua
function callHello()
    hello()
end
```

```lua
-- main.lua
require "a"
require "b"

callHello()
```

GitHub Copilot: This code will not work properly because the `hello` function defined in `a.lua` is not visible to the `callHello` function defined in `b.lua`. When `b.lua` calls `hello()` in the `callHello` function, Lua will not be able to find the `hello` function, because it is not in the global namespace.

To fix this issue, you can modify `b.lua` to explicitly reference the `hello` function in the `a` module. Here's an updated version of `b.lua`:

```lua
-- b.lua
local a = require "a"

function callHello()
    a.hello()
end
```

In this version of `b.lua`, we use the `require` function to load the `a` module, which contains the `hello` function. We then modify the `callHello` function to call `a.hello()` instead of just `hello()`. This ensures that Lua can find the `hello` function, even though it is not in the global namespace.

With these changes, the code should work properly and print "hello" when `main.lua` is run.

> then how to fix it with global namespace

GitHub Copilot: To fix the code using the global namespace, you can modify `b.lua` to declare the `hello` function as a global variable. Here's an updated version of `b.lua`:

```lua
-- b.lua
function callHello()
    _G.hello()
end
```

In this version of `b.lua`, we use the `_G` table to access the global namespace, and call the `hello` function using `_G.hello()`. This ensures that Lua can find the `hello` function, even though it is not in the same file or module.

With these changes, the code should work properly and print "hello" when `main.lua` is run. However, it's generally not recommended to use global variables in Lua, as it can lead to naming conflicts and make it harder to reason about your code. It's usually better to use local variables or modules to encapsulate your code and avoid global variables.

我在 main.lua 里面看到了`IsNotConsole`的定义, 然后在`debugprint.lua`里面看到了定义, 然后`main.lua`采用了

```lua
function IsNotConsole()
	return not IsConsole()
end

require("debugprint")
```

- [ ] 非常疑惑
